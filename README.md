# MMU-Project
MMU implementation - Java project (HIT)

In this project, I built a system to manage a memory unit.
The task of the memory unit, is to identify if a requested page is not in the RAM.
In case the page isn't there, the MMU will get it from the hard drive.

When you first initialize the unit, you choose a replacement algorithm for the MMU.

This project uses client-server, OOP (Java), GUI (Swing)
